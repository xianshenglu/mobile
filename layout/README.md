# Layout On Mobile

## Principle

- Make the font-size connect with dpr by `rem`.
- Use viewport scale to solve the problem of 1px on border and font-size.
- Make the width and height of element connect with device-width by `vw`.
- Leave the decimals to browser by `flex`.

## Con

- Sometimes decimals might bother you. At that moment you may try to leave the decimals to browser by using `flex`, `margin:auto` or other flexible property.
